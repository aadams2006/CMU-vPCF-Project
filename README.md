# Deep Embedded Clustering for VPCF Analysis
framework for using deep embedded clustering to cluster vector pair correlation function (VPCFs) from STEM data

## Project Structure
- `data/`: VPCF image data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook that walks through process of loading data, training the model, and evaluating the results
- `src/`: source code for the IDEC and DEC algorithms
- `requirements.txt`: required Python libraries
